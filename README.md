# Breast Cancer Genomics Bioinformatics Analysis  

The **Breast Cancer Genomics Bioinformatics Analysis** repository contains code, data, and results for bioinformatics analyses focused on **cardio-oncology** and **transcriptome analysis**. This repository is designed to facilitate research on the genetic and molecular aspects of breast cancer, particularly its impact on cardiovascular health and gene expression patterns.  

### Key Components:  
- **Cardio-oncology Analysis:** Investigates the relationship between breast cancer treatments and cardiovascular complications, identifying potential biomarkers and risk factors.  
- **Transcriptome Analysis:** Includes RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data processing, differential gene expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and pathway identification to understand gene regulatory mechanisms in breast cancer.  

The repository contains well-documented **scripts**, **Jupyter notebooks**, and **pipelines** for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization. Additionally, it includes **raw and processed data**, allowing users to reproduce results or apply methods to new datasets.  

Researchers and bioinformaticians can leverage this repository for **integrative genomic analysis**, helping to uncover insights into breast cancer progression, treatment responses, and associated cardiovascular risks. The project contributes to personalized medicine by providing tools for understanding transcriptomic changes and their clinical implications.
